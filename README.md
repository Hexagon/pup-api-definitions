# @pup/api-definitions

**Purpose:**

This package provides core TypeScript type definitions and interfaces that
describe the data structures and responses of the Pup REST API. It's a
foundational dependency for the following packages within the Pup project:

- `@pup/pup` - <https://github.com/hexagon/pup>
- `@pup/api-client` - <https://github.com/hexagon/pup-api-client>

**Usage**

The `@pup/api-definitions` package is not intended for direct installation.
Instead, the Pup development team and contributors primarily use it for the
following:

- **Type-safe API Interactions:** Ensure consistent and reliable communication
  between Pup components by using the provided types in other Pup-related
  packages.
- **Documentation and Code Understanding:** The interfaces serve as a clear
  reference for the Pup API's structure, aiding development and maintenance.

**Development and Contributions**

If you're actively developing components for the Pup project, this package's
types will be essential.
